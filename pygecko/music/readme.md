### Shad3dy D3stiny

Originally from the U.K and now I reside in Australia, I did not produce any of these tracks I just remixed them, tweaked them and added samples and manipulated them, they were made for fun and entertainment, for sharing with anyone who cared to take a listen. I am not a professional DJ and I do not make money off of this. I do not have any rights from LucasFilms , WarnerBros or any Music artists such as Moby and bentframe. If someone wants to get mad about it, sheese I'm sorry, gimmie a break. Gimmie a break, gimmie a break. Break me off a piece of that. What was it again? I just love experimenting with music I have mixed not just techno and hiphop, but also pink Floyd and music from movies I love! I adore mixing starwars, matrix, Snatch and other movies quotes and effects into techno, trance, Drum-n-Bass and hip hop.
