the Department of Defense Directive 4120.21, Specification and Standards =

Application, which requires all DOD components to apply selectively and =

military specifications and standards prior to their contractual =

<P><FONT size=3D4>100.3 <U>Objective</U>. The objective of this guide is =
to=20
establish the applications and limitations of tailoring MIL-STD-1521.=20
MIL-STD-1521 is not a stand-alone document. It is dependent upon the =
work effort=20
specified in the contractual requirements (e.g., SOW, etc.) The =
tailoring of=20
specifications should take place in all phases of military procurement, =
but is=20
especially applicable to the initial stages of solicitation package =
preparation=20
and contract negotiation. Depending upon the type of end-item(s) under=20
procurement, the reviews and audits outlined by MIL-STD-1521 may or may =
not be=20
required for all programs.</FONT>=20
<P><FONT size=3D4>100.4 <U>Considerations for Tailoring</U>.</FONT>=20
<P><FONT size=3D4>100.4.1 <U>Relationship to the Statement of =
work</U>.</FONT>=20
<BR><FONT size=3D4>The Program Manager must keep in mind that technical =
reviews=20
provide visibility into the contractor's implementation of the work =
effort=20
required under the terms of the SOW and the contract to assure timely =
and=20
effective attention to the technical interpretation of contract=20
requirements.</FONT> <BR><FONT size=3D4>The key to tailoring =
MIL-STD-1521 is to=20
match the MIL-STD-1521 requirements against the details of the =
applicable=20
SOW/Contractual task requirements. It will become immediately obvious =
that=20
MIL-STD-1521 may contain technical review factors that are not =
applicable to the=20
contract under consideration. (For example, if a contract does not =
include=20
computer software, all references to the review of Computer Software =
materials=20
in MIL-STD-1521 will not apply.) When MIL-STD-1521 is used, then a task=20
containing the applicable requirements will be specified in the SOW. =
Review=20
factors not set forth in MIL-STD-1521 but considered necessary because =
of the=20
nature of the particular program should be added in the SOW. By =
carefully going=20
through this evaluative process the technical review and audit =
requirements will=20
become program specific rather than an all purpose document to be =
