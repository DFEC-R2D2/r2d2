## Issues

- Impassable quagmire of wires/cables
- Tape and hot glue literally held the thing together, but the next day, things start to
fall off ... so much for duct tape being the greatest.
- Raspberry Pi camera is shorted out after being wedged (mounted) between some aluminum
- None of the LEDs are mounted, instead the holes are filled with tin foil (maybe it blocks the dark side's attempts at controlling R2?)
- Wood screws are used instead of bolts and they are falling out
- Breadboards, jumper wires and terrible soldering create a potential fire hazard
- Emergency kill switch is not correct and would not be effecting in an emergency situation
- All of the motors are improperly mounted ... generally they are strapped on instead of using the mounting holes built into them
- The battery boxes don't cover the leg motors
- The batteries are press fit into the battery boxes and cannot be removed
- The battery trade was done incorrectly and our batteries do not supply the correct current needed
- The motor driver is grossly oversized, bulky, and insanely expensive
- There is no plan for how to mount anything inside and nothing is modular
    - There are no connectors anywhere, everything is soldered together or multiple wire nuts were used to connect multiple lengths of short wires together into a larger wire
- The software is written wrong (amateur at best) and incapable of being useful
