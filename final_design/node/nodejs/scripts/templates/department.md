# Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The 21st century is an increasingly electrical one, both on the battlefield and in the workplace. Without electrical engineers, modern computers, control systems or even high-fidelity sound systems would not be possible. Computer engineers combine the hardware-design talents of an electrical engineer with the algorithm-design skills of a computer scientist to take a true “systems” view toward computing design.

## The Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering offers five areas of study:

1. Electronics – focuses on electronic design, components and applications; ideal for cadets interested in graduate studies in electrical engineering, physics, medicine or other technical fields
1. Communications – helps cadets understand satellite communications and systems, telephones, stealth technology and advanced radar systems
1. Computer Systems – explores fundamentals and advanced concepts of modern computer systems and digital hardware design
1. Controls – emphasizes the analysis and design of automatic control systems; includes courses taught by the Department of Astronautics
1. Universal Area – allows cadets to take any two electrical engineering options

Regardless of the field you chose, one thing is clear, your knowledge and skills will be in high demand both in the Air Force and in public and private industries. Set your career off on the best foot with the United States Air Force Academy’s Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering—ranked #5 by U.S. News’ Best Colleges List.
