# Computer Engineers

Computer systems are an integral part of every aspect of Air Force operations. These systems range from embedded devices that perform a specific function in a weapon system to massively-parallel supercomputers used to simulate an air campaign.

Because today’s computing systems are so sophisticated, computer engineering has evolved. Computer engineers take a true “systems” view toward computing design, combining the algorithm-design skills of a computer scientist with the hardware-design talents of an electrical engineer. Computer engineering majors acquire these skills through an interdisciplinary approach that intermingles courses from computer science with offerings from electrical and computer engineering. This program provides the broad, varied background an engineer needs to succeed in this dynamic field.

The Computer Engineering major is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.
