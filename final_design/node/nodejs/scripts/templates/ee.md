# Electrical Engineers

The battlefield of the 21st century is increasingly an electronic one, and electrical engineers (EEs) lead the way in creating the technology that dominates there. Without EEs, modern computers, control systems or even high-fidelity sound systems would not be possible.

From sophisticated sensors that detect and locate targets to the terrain following radar that aircrews depend on to “smart” computer guided munitions that attack targets with amazing accuracy, the modern military would not have its current capabilities without electronics and EEs.

The electrical engineering major covers the basic principles behind these systems and provides graduates with valuable insight into their operation. Officers who understand the technology and can use it to their advantage will have the “combat edge” over the opponent.

The Electrical Engineering major is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.
