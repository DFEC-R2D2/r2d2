# Final Code Design

There are several folders holding the final code:

- `ardunio`: holds the Arduino code for battery monitoring and ultrasound sensors
- `mechanical`: STL files for parts that were designed and 3D printed
- `node`: holds the Node.js web server code and data
- `python`: holds the python and data files that run R2
- `test`: holds a bunch of testing and debugging programs for various parts of R2
